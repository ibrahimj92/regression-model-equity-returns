This project applies Python to analyse equity index returns using Pandas and NumPy.  

It includes:  
- Cleaning and preparing raw return series  
- Running OLS regression for factor modelling  
- Conducting scenario testing and sensitivity analysis  
- Visualising regression outputs for clear insights
